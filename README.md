# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Inspiration
During this horrible pandemic, our team wanted to utilize our knowledge and return something positive back to the community especially to the frontline workers. While scrolling through our social media we have noticed that there were a lot of benefits opened for the frontline workers (https://mybetterliving.ca/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Offers-Available-.pdf). Therefore, we wanted to develop an application that will allow the busy healthcare workers to easily access information for those benefits through one source. 
## What it does
Obtained every piece of information from the attached pdf and sortes them according to the location (Province,  Territories) and categories (Food & Beverages, Accommodations, Miscellaneous). Pinpoints the nearest benefit offering store according to the user's instant location.
## How we built it
Imported data into Google Firebase for easy data access, enabled Google Map API to display the map with the marker and information, detects the nearest location of the store according to the user's area. The frontend user interface is built with JavaScript and React along with Semantic UI.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
